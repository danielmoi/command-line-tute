## But why bother learning the command line?

### 1. Productivity
The command line is available on all computers.

- connect to remote databases
- update remote server files

### 2. Cool things
Here are some [examples](/cool-things.md) of some neat things we can do in the command line.


## But why another tutorial on the command line?
Yep, there are lots of tutorials out there already - and I learnt so much from reading and
following many tutorials and articles.

As I delved deeper into the command line, I took notes from my gleanings and pickings - that's one of the ways
I learn new things. I wanted to consolidate my scattered notes into a single repository, and
decided to turn it into a tutorial - I hope you find it helpful!
