# Setup


## Terminal
We're going to install iTerm2 as our terminal.

We will use this as our terminal instead of the stock Terminal application that comes with macOS.

Website: https://www.iterm2.com

Soure code: https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2

From the website, "iTerm2 is a terminal emulator for macOS that does amazing things".

Remember that "terminal emulator" refers to software that mimics remote physical hardware (the classic sense of the word "terminal"). A "terminal emulator" is like a "virtual terminal".

Some of the features of iTerm2:
- split panes
- 256+ colors
- configurability
- profiles

## Steps
1. Download iTerm2 application
2. Drag icon into Dock
3. Open application
4. Done!

## iTerm2
Your terminal should look like this:
