# Permissions


When we initially created our `magic.sh` shell script, these were the permissions.

```
-rw-r-xr--   1 danielmoi  staff     42 22 Apr 11:55 magic.sh
```

After running this command:
```
$ chmod 755 magic.sh
```

We got this:
```
-rwxr-xr-x   1 danielmoi  staff     42 22 Apr 11:55 magic.sh
```
