## Description
`htop` is an interactive system-monitor process-viewer and process-manager.

Its name is derived from
- its author's name
- `top` (table of processes), another Linux program, on which it is based.

It is written in the C programming language, using the `ncurses` library.

It is similar to `ps` (which produces a static snapshot of processes at the time of invocation).

The `htop` screen provides real-time information about
- the processes running in the system
- the load on the cores in the system
