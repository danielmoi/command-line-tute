# Tab Completion

## Usage
```
$ <char><TAB>
```

---
## Description
The command line allows the user to type the first (few) characters of a command or filename, and
pressing a completion key (`<TAB>`) to fill in the rest of the string.

There are several benefits to this:
- TIME: fewer keystrokes are needed to access a particular command/filename
- ACCURACY: strings are easy to mis-type, and commands/filenames with long/unusual names are easily mis-typed
