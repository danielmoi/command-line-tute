# `less`

## Name
Less

----
## Usage

```
less fileName
```


----
## Description
Terminal pager program.

View file, one screen at a time.

Allows forward and backward navigation (unlike `more`)

Faster load times than other Unix editors/viewers because `less` doesn't read the entire file before loading.

---
## Examples
```
less README.md      View README.md, one page at a time

ls | less           List directory, one page at a time
```
